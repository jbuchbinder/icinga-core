What is Icinga?

Icinga is a fork of Nagios and is backward compatible. So, Nagios configurations, plugins
and addons can all be used with Icinga. Though Icinga retains all the existing features
of its predecessor, it builds on them to add many long awaited patches and features
requested by the user community.

Icinga is an enterprise grade open source monitoring system which keeps watch over a
network and any conceivable network resource, notifies the user of errors and recoveries,
and generates performance data for reporting.
Scalable and extensible, Icinga can monitor complex, large environments across dispersed
locations. Icinga is licensed under GPL V2 and is free to use, distribute and modify.


With Icinga you can:

MONITOR – ANY NETWORK AND ALL ITS RESOURCES

Network services: SMTP, POP3, HTTP, SNMP, NNTP, PING, etc.
Host resources: CPU load, disk utilization, system logs, etc
Server components: Switches, routers, temperature and humidity sensors, etc

NOTIFY –WHEN ISSUES ARISE AND ARE RESOLVED

Through any channel (eMail, SMS, phone call, etc)
Escalate alerts to other users or communication channels
Fine tune notification settings (accounting for dependencies between hosts & services)

REPORT – ON PERFORMANCE AND PLAN AHEAD

Capacity utilization to plan for growth
Chart graphs with addons like PNP or Grapher

Icinga takes open source monitoring to the next level - check out the features new and old.
