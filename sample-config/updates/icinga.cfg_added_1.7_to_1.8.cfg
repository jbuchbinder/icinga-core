# These are newly ADDED config options for ICINGA.CFG only.
#
# NOTE: Update your existing configuration with those new ones,
#	if needed. You are advised to do so, in order to get the
#	full Icinga experience!
#################################################################



# MAX CHECK RESULT LIST ITEMS !!EXPERIMENTAL!!
# This experimental option allows you to set the max number of items
# the checkresult reaper will put onto the checkresult list for further
# processing by the core. If there are too many, the reaping will be
# terminated early, allowing the core to process the results sooner.
# On larger setups, that list might grow too much, and decrease
# performance on processing. You might experiment with that value, the
# inner core default is set to 0, disabling that feature.
# Values:
#  0 = Disable max check result list items
#  number = set max check result list items

#max_check_result_list_items=1024


# KEEP UNKNOWN MACROS
# This option can be used to keep unknown macros within the output.
# e.g. check_proc -C $foo$ will remain.
# This was the default in versions older than Icinga 1.8, but now
# the default is to remove those macros from the output, causing
# the shell to interpret $foo and leaving a single $ there. See
# #2291 for further information.
# Make sure to escape single dollar signs with another '$', as the
# docs describe. Other than that, enable this setting to revert to
# the old behaviour.

keep_unknown_macros=0


# STATE BASED ESCALATION RANGES !!!Experimental!!!
# This option allows you to enable state based escalation ranges which
# will allow a more detailed granularity on when an escalation notification
# may happen, adding a filter based on the current host or service state
# when checking the escalation for notification viability.
# This is a behavioural change to the default, and therefore intentionally
# disabled. Enable at your own risk, as this remains an experimental feature.
# Values: 1 = enable state based escalation ranges,
# 0 = disable state based escalation ranges

#enable_state_based_escalation_ranges=0
