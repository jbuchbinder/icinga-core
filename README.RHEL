Introduction
------------

CHANGES for 1.7
* bindir/idomod.o => libdir/idomod.so
* /var/icinga => /var/spool/icinga
* icinga-idoutils => icinga-idoutils-libdbi-mysql and icinga-idoutils-libdbi-pgsql


The packages are made as little dependend on each other as possible, to get the
maximum flexibility in setting up distributed monitoring environments. This
means, that you may have to install some additional packages manually. Yum is
your friend.

Recommended OS Installation
---------------------------

Repositories:
* Fedora EPEL repository (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL)
* RHN Channel "Red Hat Optional Server" if using RHEL
* Repoforge repository if needed (http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/RPMForge)

It is also recommended to switch SELinux to "disabled" or develop a proper policy
for icinga et al (if you have it, share it ;-)).

Order of Installation
---------------------

Keeping a certain order of installation will lead you to a working monitoring
setup in a relatively short time. Use yum to pull the proper dependencies
automatically.

1. Install icinga

2. Install the needed nagios-plugins (either Fedora EPEL repository or Repoforge
   "yum search nagios-plugins" gives you a list)

3. If you need or want the classic gui, install icinga-gui. If you want plain
   monitoring with icinga core and configure everything else by hand, you are done.

3.1 An example user icingaadmin with password icingaadmin is installed to
	/etc/icinga/passwd

3.1 Add a new basic auth user for apache:
	# htpasswd /etc/icinga/passwd youradmin

4. Optional: install icinga-idoutils. Icinga Data Output Utils are necessary for
   various database backed guis such as Icinga Web or Icinga Reporting. IDOUtils
   use the libdbi database abstraction layer and can use MySQL or Postgresql with
   this package.
	- icinga-idoutils-libdbi-mysql
	- icinga-idoutils-libdbi-pgsql

4.1 Create the idoutils database. For details see the README.RHEL.idoutils of the
    icinga-idoutils-libdbi-* package.
    Detailed information can be found in the "Creation of Database and IDOUtils" section
    in the official docs as well as the wiki howtos.
    http://docs.icinga.org/latest/en/quickstart-idoutils.html
    https://wiki.icinga.org/display/howtos/Setting+up+Icinga+with+IDOUtils

5. Optional: install additional Icinga guis like Icinga Web or Icinga Reporting as well
   as addons such as PNP4Nagios, Check_MK or NagVis. For a suggested list please
   either consult the docs or the wiki, or ask community members at monitoring-portal.org


Troubleshooting
---------------

- check if you have set SELinux to "disabled" mode
- check that your local firewall rules contain appropriate rules for the
  webserver and non-local database-connections
- start the components in the rigth order: database, ido2db, icinga, httpd
- check if idomod loads correctly
  (/var/log/icinga/icinga.log: idomod: Successfully connected to data sink)
- check the httpd error.log, the icinga.log and the syslog
- in case of possible bugs, turn on debugging and refer to the debug logs
